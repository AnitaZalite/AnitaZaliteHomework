            <div class="facts-text">
                
                    <ul>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                        <li>Paradigm - event-driven, functional,imperative</li>
                        <li>Designed by - initially Brendan Eich of Netscape</li>
                        <li>    First appeared - December 4, 1995</li>
                        <li>Filename extensions - .js .cjs .mjs</li>
                        <li>Website - <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/">https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/</a> </li>
                    </ul>   
                
                
            </div>
                
        </div>
        <p>The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations, unless explicitly specified otherwise:</p>
            
        <div class="menu-container">
            <div class="first">Imperative and structured</div>
                <div class="first-text">JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; then block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.</div>

            <div class="second">Weakly typed</div>
                <div class="second-text">
                    JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The binary + operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator</li>
                            <li>The binary - operator always casts both operands to a number</li>
                            <li>Both unary operators (+, -) always cast the operand to a number</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        Values are cast to strings like the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strings are left as-is</li>
                            <li>Numbers are converted to their string representation;</li>
                            <li>Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (,);</li>
                            <li>Other objects are converted to the string [object Object] where Object is the name of the constructor of the object</li>
                        </ul>
                </div>
                 
            <div class="third">Dynamic</div>
                <div class="third-text">JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string.[46] JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.</div>
        
            <div class="fourth">Object-orientation (prototype-based)</div>
                <div class="fourth-text">In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (obj.x = 10) and bracket notation (obj['x'] = 10). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a for...in loop.</div>
            
            <div class="fifth">Functional</div>
        
                <div class="fifth-text">A function is first-class; a function is considered to be an object. As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as .call() and .bind().A nested function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. In addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: The lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes. JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.</p>
            
        
            <div class="sixth">Delegative</div>
                <div class="sixth-text">JavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.</div>
